Beginner Tableau Project

Project Overview: This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing the 2022 Index of Economic Freedom using Tableau Public. The objective is to provide a comprehensive, interactive dashboard that allows users to explore how different countries perform across 12 economic indicators, categorized into four major pillars: Rule of Law, Government Size, Regulatory Efficiency, and Open Markets.

Objective: The aim of this project is to make complex economic data more accessible and understandable through visual storytelling. By using Tableau’s interactive features, the dashboard enables users—such as students, educators, researchers, and policymakers—to:

Compare the performance of countries and regions

Understand patterns and disparities in global economic freedom

Analyze economic indicators in the context of growth and development

Key Features: Region-wise and country-wise filtering

Multiple visualizations including bar charts, maps, pie charts, and scatter plots

Story section summarizing key findings

Calculated fields to display average scores and group comparisons

Tooltip insights for each indicator and visual element

Tools and Technologies Used: Tableau Public for data visualization

Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets for data preprocessing

Mural for brainstorming and planning

Diagrams.net for architectural and DFD diagrams

PDF and Word tools for documentation

Data Source: The data is sourced from the Heritage Foundation’s official 2022 Index of Economic Freedom dataset, which evaluates more than 180 countries on the basis of 12 quantitative and qualitative indicators.

How to Use: The dashboard can be accessed via Tableau Public. Users can interact with filters to select specific regions, countries, or indicators and explore various visualizations to gain insights. The story section guides the user through key highlights and findings from the dataset.

Conclusion: This project demonstrates how public economic data can be transformed into an engaging and insightful analytical tool using Tableau. It serves as a resource for understanding economic freedom across the world and supports data-driven learning and policy evaluation.
